GNEX - the GNU emacs port of Kent Pitman's EMACS key bindings known as NEX
=====

(The name NEX was coined by Kent and I'm not sure what it stands for.
I always think of it as "New Emacs eXperimental."  It's an apparent
reference to NE which is what the newest pre-release version of E
(EMACS) was called on ITS.  "New" of course means "new as of 1980".)
